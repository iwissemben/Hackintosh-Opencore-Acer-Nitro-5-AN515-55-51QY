## About Bluetooth (& WiFi)
<p align="center">
  <img width="350" alt="Broadcom BCM94352z illustration" src="Documentation/illustrations/broadcom_94352z.png">
</p>

Getting Bluetooth and AirDrop as well as Continuity and Handoff services to work was too much of a struggle with the Intel WiFi card. These features were working randomly and the AirPods kept getting disconnected.

I found out that some 2-in-1 cards were natively supported by macOS and worked out of the box (OOTB) (or at least until Sonoma). For Sonoma and above, kexts would be able to bring back full functionality to those specific cards.

That is why I chose to <b>transition</b> from the Intel WiFi AX201 Card with a <b>[Fenvi Broadcom BCM94352z](https://www.fenvi.com/product_detail_40.html)</b> that can be found at an unbeatable price in many stores.

For many tutorials, this Broadcom card is considered as a <u><b> "Modern WiFi card" "Non-Apple AirPort and Non-Fenvi Card" </b></u>, the Bluetooth part as a separate dongle.

### Methodology
In a spirit of consistency and continuity, I chose to add Broadcom support using the latest version of my EFI ([v1.2.0](https://github.com/iwissemben/Hackintosh-Opencore-Acer-Nitro-5-AN515-55-51QY/releases/tag/V.1.2.0)) as base before continuing to upgrade the non-related kexts and bootloader.

Thus everything detailed below uses the same OpenCore bootloader version (V.0.9.8), and kexts versions (except for the `Lilu.kext`).

### Consequences

#### Kexts side

To enable support of the Broadcom BCM94352z WiFi/Bluetooth card here is what has changed on a Kext level, and in the future all kexts will only be updated. 
- First, all Intel AX201 related kexts are disabled (but not deleted) : 
    - `IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext`
    - `IntelBTPatcher.kext`
    - `AirportItlwm.kext`

- Secondly, new Broadcom BCM94352z kexts are added :
    - `AMFIPass.kext`: Disable AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity) without requiring supplementary boot-args, thus allows OCLP root patching. 
        - To handle this kext's functionality with EFI ([v1.2.0](https://github.com/iwissemben/Hackintosh-Opencore-Acer-Nitro-5-AN515-55-51QY/releases/tag/V.1.2.0)), `Lilu.kext` had to be updated (1.6.7 -> 1.7.0)

    - WiFi Kexts:
        - `IOSkywalkFamily.kext`
        - `IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext`
        - `AirPortBrcmFixup.kext`

    - Bluetooth kexts:
        - `BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext` *macOS VerDep
        - `BrcmFirmwareData.kext` *macOS VerDep
        - `BrcmPatchRAM.kext` *macOS VerDep
        - `BrcmPatchRAM2.kext` *macOS VerDep
        - `BrcmPatchRAM3.kext` *macOS VerDep

- `BlueToolFixup.kext` has to be kept on to enable Bluetooth functionality in either case.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> *macOS VerDep: Kexts are Kernel version dependent to allow their dynamic activation, more info [on utilizing `minKernel` and `maxKernel` settings](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#utilizing-minkernel-and-maxkernel-settings).


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To bring back Intel AX201 support, disable Broadcom's kexts except `BlueToolFixup.kext` as it is used to enable WiFi functionality in either case.



#### OCLP patching
As Apple removed support of unsoldered Broadcom WiFi/Bluetooth cards since Sonoma, in addition to kexts, the Broadcom BCM94352z requires OCLP patching to work again. OCLP patching is a process of customizing the OpenCore bootloader.
- Using it needs the [OpenCore Legacy Patcher app](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) (min version `2.4.0`) 
- Requires to:
    - <u> Disable</u> `SecureBootModel`
    - <u> Partially disable</u> System Integrity Protection (`SIP`)
    - <u> Disable</u> Apple Mobile File Integrity (`AMFI`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `SecureBootModel` can be re-enabled after Root patching.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `AMFI` can be disabled by adding the `amfi=0x80` boot-arg to the NVRAM, or using `AMFIPass.kext`. I chose the latter as it is 'more visible and clean' than the boot-arg method.
> More information on the matter [here](#Credits).

#### bluetoothExternalDongleFailed
Despite adding a `bluetoothExternalDongleFailed = 00` entry to the NVRAM ([see guides](#Credits)), Bluetooth (and AirDrop) were disabled after a cold boot. To make it work I had to reset NVRAM twice after each cold boot. 

After some investigation, I saw that after each cold boot `bluetoothExternalDongleFailed` kept getting reset to `01`.

Resetting NVRAM twice each time being laborious, I discovered [Lawrence Bates/LBates2000](#Lawrence_Bates_LBates2000)'s trick to reset it to `00` on startup.

While Lawrence's solution didn't work for me (probably because I'm not on macOS Sequoia yet) it set me on the right track to solve the issue.

Please see the tutorial to fix it [here](/Documentation/Broadcom_BCM94352z/bluetoothExternalDongleFailed-fix.md)
